### Pairing
Additional steps are required because the Peanut Smart Plug does not provide a \`modelId\` in its database entry,
and thus zigbee2mqtt cannot identify the product or how to handle it.

Reset the device and initiate pairing mode by holding the pairing button
(the small button next to the on/off button) for ten seconds, releasing the button,
and unplugging the device.
When plugged back in, the front LED will be blinking red and ready to receive a pairing request.
When paired successfully, the red LED on the plug will stop blinking.

After pairing, you must stop zigbee2mqtt and manually edit the zigbee2mqtt \`database.db\` file with a
text editor (note that the file may be owned by root).
Find each line where the Peanut Smart Plug is listed (look for "SecuriFi Ltd." in the \`ManufName\` field)
and **add** \`"modelId":"PP-WHT-US",\` between two existing fields.

*For example,* change \`..."manufId":4098,"manufName":"Securifi Ltd....\`
to \`..."manufId":4098,"modelId":"PP-WHT-US","manufName":"Securifi Ltd....\`

### Pairing
Philips LivingColors IRIS and Philips LivingColors Bloom Devices that comes with
Philips (HUE) Remote Gen 2 (Touch Wheel) or Gen 3 (Round Click Wheel) can be paired via Zigbee.
Devices with Gen 1 Remote don't use Zigbee and can not be paired.
The Philips LivingColors Remote can not be paired via Zigbee because it only support ZigBee Light Link (ZLL).

To Pair hold Button ON and Bottom Left Key (Favorite 1) on the Remote in Front of the Device until
the Device Light blinks and lights Orange. If connection was succesfull the Device Light will light Green.

**WARNING**: If you pair your Device to a Zigbee Network which is not using a ZLL Channel
you can't reset the Device with the Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 3.
The Gen 3 Remote will only try ZLL Channels to find the Device! Maybe it's possible to reset
the Device with a Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 2 as it should try all Zigbee Channels to find the Device.

* \`no_occupancy_since\`: Timeout (in seconds) after \`no_occupancy_since\` is send.
This indicates the time since last occupancy was detected.
For example \`no_occupancy_since: [10, 60]\` will send a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 10}\` after 10 seconds
and a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 60}\` after 60 seconds.

If not set, the timeout is \`90\` seconds.
When set to \`0\` no \`occupancy: false\` is send.

**IMPORTANT**: \`occupancy_timeout\` should not be set to lower than 60 seconds.
The reason is this: after detecting a motion the sensor ignores any movements for
exactly 60 seconds. In case there are movements after this, a new message
(\`occupancy: true\`) will be sent and the sensor will go for one more minute sleep, and so on.
This is expected behaviour (see [#270](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/270#issuecomment-414999973)).

### Toggle button
When clicking the middle (center) button on the remote it will send a \`{"click": "toggle"}\`, when holding it
it will **also** send a \`{"click": "toggle_hold"}\`. It is not possible to skip the \`toggle\` when the button is hold.
Also the remote won't send anything when the button is released.
See [link](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2077#issuecomment-538691885) for more details.

### Power measurements
This device only support power measurements with an up-to-date firmware on the plug which can only be done
via the original hub. In case of an older firmware you will only see 0 values in the measurements.

### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_ID]/set\` various device attributes can be configured:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "windowCoveringType": xxx,
        "configStatus": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitLiftCm": xxx,
        "installedClosedLimitLiftCm": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitTiltDdegree": xxx,
        "installedClosedLimitTiltDdegree": xxx,
        "turnaroundGuardTime": xxx,
        "liftToTiltTransitionSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "liftToTiltTransitionSteps2": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx,
        "additionalSteps": xxx,
        "inactivePowerThreshold": xxx,
        "startupSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx
    }
}
\`\`\`
For further details on these attributes please take a look at the
[ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5. Window Covering Cluster (Server)".

As an alternative to the attributes listed above, the following properties may be used for convenience:
* \`open_to_closed_s\`: corresponds to \`totalSteps\`, but takes value in seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`closed_to_open_s\`: ditto for \`totalSteps2\`,
* \`lift_to_tilt_transition_ms\`: sets both \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps\` and \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps2\`
(they shall both be equal according to ubisys manual), but takes value in *milli*seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`steps_per_second\`: factor to be used for conversion, defaults to 50 full AC waves per second if not provided

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_ID]/get/configure_j1\` the values of the configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal zigbee2mqtt log.

### Calibration
By publishing \`{"configure_j1": {"calibrate": 1}}\` to \`zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_ID]/set\` the device can also be
calibrated after installation to support more advanced positioning features
(i.e. go to lift percentage / go to tilt percentage). This can be combined with setting attributes as shown above,
for example:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "calibrate" : 1,
        "windowCoveringType": 8,
        "lift_to_tilt_transition_ms": 1600
    }
}
\`\`\`
The calibration procedure will move the shutter up and down several times and the current stage of the
calibration process will again be logged to the normal zigbee2mqtt log for the user to get some feedback.
For details on the calibration procedure please again take a look at
the [ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5.1. Calibration".
Please note that tilt transition steps cannot be determined automatically and must therefore be
configured manually for the device to also support "go to tilt percentage". One possibility to determine the
correct value is to take a video of the blinds moving from 0 to 100 percent tilt and then getting the exact timing
from the video by playing it slow motion.

### Home Assistant cover features when using [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant)
The cover will be offered to Home Assistant as supporting lift and tilt by default, but for covers with reduced
functionality this can be passed along to Home Assistant by disabling some of the topics in \`configuration.yaml\`,
for example:
\`\`\`yaml
'0x001fee0000001234':
    friendly_name: cover_not_supporting_tilt'
    homeassistant:
    tilt_command_topic: null
    tilt_status_topic: null
'0x001fee0000001234':
    friendly_name: cover_supporting_neither_lift_nor_tilt'
    homeassistant:
    set_position_topic: null
    position_topic: null
    tilt_command_topic: null
    tilt_status_topic: null
\`\`\`
`,
